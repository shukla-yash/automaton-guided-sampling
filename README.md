# automaton-guided-sampling
Automaton guided task sampling for RL agents


To train: ```python train.py```. Policies saved to ```PPO_preTrained```

To test: ```python test.py```. Loads policies from ```PPO_preTrained```

Currently, ```PPO_preTrained``` contains successfully trained policies for ```MiniGrid-NineRoomsEasyKey-v0``` and ```MiniGrid-NineRoomsHardKey-v0```
